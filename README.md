# BlackBoardVGA001
This is an experiment in making a DMA-based VGA output using an STM32F4VE 'black board'.

[https://os.mbed.com/users/hudakz/code/STM32F407VET6_Hello/shortlog/](https://os.mbed.com/users/hudakz/code/STM32F407VET6_Hello/shortlog/ "Info on STM32F4VE board")

This is a work-in-progress.  At this time:

- SDIO and FatFS
- USB CDC
- 'monitor' task
- LEDs
- SPI1 configured for external flash; no interface code, though
